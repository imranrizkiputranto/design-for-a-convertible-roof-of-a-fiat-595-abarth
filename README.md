# Design For a Convertible Roof of a Fiat 595 Abarth

Group project involving the design of a convertible roof mechanism of a Fiat 595 Abarth. The initial mechanism was first design in a simple programme called Linkage and was created in detail in Autodesk Fusion 360, alongside a Finite Element Analysis model. Mathematical models in MATLAB relating the motor, gears, dampers and drag were created.
